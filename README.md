<a id="learning-phantom">Tutorials on phantom and Cassandra</a>
======================================================================

For ease of use and far better management of documentation, we have decided to export the `README.md` to a proper
Wiki page, now available [here](https://github.com/outworkers/phantom/wiki/).

The following are the current resources available for learning phantom, outside of tests which are very useful in
highlighting all the possible features in phantom and how to use them.

<a id="issues-and-questions">Issues and questions</a>
=====================================================
<a href="#table-of-contents">back to top</a>

We love Cassandra to bits and use it in every bit of our stack. phantom makes it super trivial for Scala users to embrace Cassandra.

Cassandra is highly scalable and it is by far the most powerful database technology available, open source or otherwise.

Phantom is built on top of the [Datastax Java Driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver), which does most of the heavy lifting.

We are very happy to help implement missing features in phantom, answer questions about phantom, and occasionally help you out with Cassandra questions! Please use GitHub for any issues or bug reports.

- You can use phantom in commercial products or otherwise, so long as you use one of the official versions available on Bintray or Maven Central.

- You are not allowed to distribute altered copies of phantom in binary form.

- You cannot offer paid for training on phantom unless you are a direct partner to `Outworkers` and you have a written intellectual property agreement in place with us.

- If you simply have a `Build.scala` or `build.sbt` dependency on phantom, you have nothing to worry about.

- All paid for features are published and sold separately as `phantom-pro`, everything that is currently available for free will remain so forever.

Phantom was developed at outworkers as an in-house project. All Cassandra integration at outworkers goes through phantom, and nowadays it's safe to say most
Scala/Cassandra users in the world rely on phantom.
